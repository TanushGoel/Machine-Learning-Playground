## Facial Keypoint Detection
CNN model trained to find facial keypoints within an image.

## Image Captioning
Encoder-Decoder attention model that generates captions from images - trained on COCO dataset.

## Chest_XRays.ipynb
Detects the presence of pneumonia in a given chest x-ray image. Binary classification between "normal" and "pneumonia" classes.

## DengAI_Predicting_Disease_Spread.ipynb
Predicting the number of local epidemics of dengue fever.
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. In mild cases, symptoms are similar to the flu: fever, rash, and muscle and joint pain. In severe cases, dengue fever can cause severe bleeding, low blood pressure, and even death.

## Diabetic_Retinopathy.ipynb
Multi-Class classification of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). 

## Malaria_Detection_with_Automated_Hyperparameter_Tuning.ipynb
Detecting the presence of malaria in cell images.

## Predicting_Molecular_Properties_Catboost.ipynb
Developing an algorithm that can predict the magnetic interaction between two atoms in a molecule (i.e., the scalar coupling constant). Using NMR to gain insight into a molecule’s structure and dynamics depends on the ability to accurately predict so-called “scalar couplings”. These are effectively the magnetic interactions between a pair of atoms. The strength of this magnetic interaction depends on intervening electrons and chemical bonds that make up a molecule’s three-dimensional structure. A fast and reliable method to predict these interactions will allow medicinal chemists to gain structural insights faster and cheaper, enabling scientists to understand how the 3D chemical structure of a molecule affects its properties and behavior.

## Santander_Transactions.ipynb
Identifying which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted.

## Skin_Cancer_Classification.ipynb
Multi-Class classification of skin cancer in images.
